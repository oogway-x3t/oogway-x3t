Welcome to oogway-x3t!

âœ¨ In this repository, I aim to share scripts, programs, best practices, and how-tos about cloud technologies such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and particularly K8s with AI integration âœ¨

About Me

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on diverse projects to deepen my knowledge in Kubernetes (K8s), exploring public cloud variants like EKS, AKS, and GKE!

ðŸŒ± Currently learning GitHub Actions and planning to explore Go, Terraform, Jenkins, and AI next!

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on Kubernetes projects, especially those focused on building AI-driven controllers.

ðŸ¤” Looking for opportunities to integrate AI within Kubernetes environments â€“ it's fascinating!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything related to AWS, GCP, or Kubernetes!

ðŸ“« You can reach me at: github.slip810@passmail.com

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

âš¡ Fun fact: Why don't Kubernetes pods go to the beach? Because they're afraid of getting too many nodes! ðŸ˜„

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
